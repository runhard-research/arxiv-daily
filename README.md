### Geometry of Reason: Spectral Signatures of Valid Mathematical Reasoning
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00791v1
- **Summary**:
  - We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns.
  - By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs.

### InfoSynth: Information-Guided Benchmark Synthesis for LLMs
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00575v1
- **Summary**:
  - Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in reasoning and code generation.
  - However, efficiently creating new benchmarks to evaluate these capabilities remains a challenge.

### Rule-Based Approaches to Atomic Sentence Extraction
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00506v1
- **Summary**:
  - Natural language often combines multiple ideas into complex sentences.
  - Atomic sentence extraction, the task of decomposing complex sentences into simpler sentences that each express a single idea, improves performance in information retrieval, question answering, and automated reasoning systems.

### Language as Mathematical Structure: Examining Semantic Field Theory Against Language Games
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00448v1
- **Summary**:
  - Large language models (LLMs) offer a new empirical setting in which long-standing theories of linguistic meaning can be examined.
  - This paper contrasts two broad approaches: social constructivist accounts associated with language games, and a mathematically oriented framework we call Semantic Field Theory.

### The Role of Mixed-Language Documents for Multilingual Large Language Model Pretraining
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00364v1
- **Summary**:
  - Multilingual large language models achieve impressive cross-lingual performance despite largely monolingual pretraining.
  - While bilingual data in pretraining corpora is widely believed to enable these abilities, details of its contributions remain unclear.

## Multimodal (MLLM)

### CRoPS: A Training-Free Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Vision-Language Models
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00659v1
- **Summary**:
  - Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use.
  - Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur.

### RoboReward: General-Purpose Vision-Language Reward Models for Robotics
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00675v1
- **Summary**:
  - A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement.
  - In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives.

### CRoPS: A Training-Free Hallucination Mitigation Framework for Vision-Language Models
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00659v1
- **Summary**:
  - Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use.
  - Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur.

### Quality Detection of Stored Potatoes via Transfer Learning: A CNN and Vision Transformer Approach
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00645v1
- **Summary**:
  - Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction.
  - In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions.

### Noise-Robust Tiny Object Localization with Flows
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00617v1
- **Summary**:
  - Despite significant advances in generic object detection, a persistent performance gap remains for tiny objects compared to normal-scale objects.
  - We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting.

### Vision-based Goal-Reaching Control for Mobile Robots Using a Hierarchical Learning Framework
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00610v1
- **Summary**:
  - Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in many robotic applications, but it requires extensive exploration of the state-action space, during which behaviors can be unsafe.
  - This significantly limits its applicability to large robots with complex actuators operating on unstable terrain.

### DynaDrag: Dynamic Drag-Style Image Editing by Motion Prediction
- **arXiv**: http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00542v1
- **Summary**:
  - To achieve pixel-level image manipulation, drag-style image editing which edits images using points or trajectories as conditions is attracting widespread attention.
  - Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues.
